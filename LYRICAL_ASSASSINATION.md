thanks.  here were the full lyrics.. some changed a lot didn't actually make it in... maybe a second track will have to be made. :-) 


i regret wasting the filesystem diss with "like yo filesystem you fat" instead of going with the much more brutal reiserfs reference you'll find below (which would be lost on anyone that does not know the hans reiser murder saga anyway)

but here's the verses plus some extras. i know you get the references but in case it wasn't clear enough to hear in the song. 

--
first name uid last name zero 
in etc shadow i'll make it clear -oh 
you still sudo? 
yeah i just do tho' 
like windows you unstable 
things i do you ain't able
enable
like cisco 
not the rapper but the router 
hit the bar like the space but in outer where them girlies throws digits after me 
i'm efficient like Erastothenes 
sievin' prime and inequal 
sometimes i speak sql 
LLM PIMP 
i'm multilingual 
spit a BAR? nah FOO! 
parallel superscalar and virtual 
NLP Python get it on 
listen to me throw 
all the wisdom i bestow 
maybe bash maybe go 
by and large 
i undercharge 
my intellect 
don't bother double check 
don't gotta guess or recollect 
pop a shell 
strace 
yo face 
condition i race 
whoami 
zero uid 
who 
last 
w 
id 
0
process hero

i'm going through them
i'm rootin
no place like local host
loopback this crack
find me back 
in my home dir
where the hard drive is

fsck
halt

while i grep
you just cat
like yo filesystem
you fat
you gettin patched
yeah i wrote that
with at

process highest priority

i'm setuid
i won't pingback
i'll just ack
your request
cuz i'm the best
i'm a SYNner
stack winner
to my expert
you a beginner

wrote my first code in a telnet session
good luck asking ChatGPbiTch yo question
my system uptime longer than your whole career
you sweat uptime, i drink beer
your lame future becoming clearer
in an old rsync mirror

what time it is
say that in UTC
restart your job
i'm automatic-a-ly

syntax highlight 
i'm too bright
sigTERM goodnight
my sigKILL you can't fight

exit zero
justify right
every byte
i write
kernel sing
ring zero

like raid you redundant
my skills are abundant
like windows you're unstable
what i do you ain't able
single disk 
you high risk
i'm beautiful 
immutable
my data
i never lose

rollback
rewrite
forkbomb
reuse

disable control flow, 
xon/xoff 
xterm 
x'd out 
not pwnin' 
just a pawn 
already gone 
a null route 
dev/nulled 
on you dee pee 
i pee 
on everything 
like you 
ring zero 
kernel panic 
not satanic 
but a daemon 
on start up 
my server up time 
longer than your career 
did you hear 
i know you phear 
my tcp 
i p 
in irc 
#hack while you in slack 
or discord 
you edgelord 
umbilical 
cat 5 
i cut your cord 
now you wireless 
and i'm tireless 
coding for daze 
on three phase 
and dc 
like udp you unreliable 
it's undeniable 
my check sums are verifiable 
two to the 10ths 
for two hours 
my root powers 
your beige towers 
of shame 
while you play games 
i work 
mechanical turk you barely earning 
i got ultra wide scsi disk still turning 
15 thousand rpm 
nah son that i build from source 
of course 
you're confused 
without that mouse that you use 
my keyboards loud 
been in the cloud 
before it had a name 
net hack and doom the only game 
you lame 
you mainframe 
i got a pdp that runs 
vax vms or RST-S 
I RST your sess- 
ddos your life 
fsck your wife 
yeah it's terminal 
a little german'll 
she be with hans reiser 
eff ess 
she fat 
like my moog synthesizer 
[moog bass n 808 breakdown] 
die 
logout 
kill term
yo ops 
you bankicked fo life -- 
You runnin' Windows? 
My condolences, fam 
Reboot twice just to load up your RAM 
BSOD? More like Bitch, Stop, Or Die 
I run a headless Arch box just to flex on the sky 
Git pull? You a fool, can’t even diff 
Every merge commit made someone on yo team quit. 
Yo, I’m a SIGKILL assassin, 
you a soft reboot mute 
My alias is root, 
my ops absolute 
You a login loop, 
I just execute 
You buffer overflown, 
while my stacks protected 
I chown the throne, 
now your shell rejected 
Tryna fork?
Boy, you gettin’ SIGSTOPPED 
I’m piped into greatness, 
you got EOF’d --- 
kill nice hangup shutdown trap abort break exec 
i got chicks a plenty 
you gots a vic-20 
hip hip hooray 
your 99's a 4A 
so gay 
go play 
with the kids 
and watch yo youtube vids 
i apropos your dot plan 
you tryna figure out 'man man'
