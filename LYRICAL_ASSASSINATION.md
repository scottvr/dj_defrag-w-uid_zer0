# El User - DJ Defraag deaat. UID Zer0

This document might more accuraately be named LYRICAL_EXPLANATION.md,
but that name doesn't sound as cool, especially from the diss track
battle raapper persona. In the lyrics "UID Zer0" is referred to as "author",
and "luser" (El User) is the "listener"

-- 

> first name uid last name zero 
UID (user id) 0 is reserved for `root`, the superuser, in UNIX and Unix-like (Linux) Operating Systems. This is the target of privilege escalation "zero days" (another allusion to Zer0) and is roughly equivalent to "local Administrator" in Windows environments.

So it's our introduction, in hip hop style, to say I am the "superuser".

> in /etc/shadow i'll make it clear 
/etc/shadow was an improvement over earlier Unix password storage schemes where `/etc/passwd1 contained  
local userid, group, home directory and GECOS fiield information as well as the actual crypt()ed password value. On shadowed password systems the crypted value was moved to the readable-by-root-only file `/etc/shadow`, while the mostly-not-sensitive fields mentioned above remained in the world-readable `/etc/passwd` file. It's another allusion to me being the super user since I have the ability to make something clear in the file `/etc/shadow` (presumably by modifying) it`

> (oh) you still sudo? 
Logging in directly as the root user became discouraged for many reasons, from just "too easy to forget you were in the superuser's shell" to formal compliance specs that forbade this, largely for the same "too easy" reason as well as more rigid enforcement of policies forbidding passsword-sharing (multiple sysadmins knowing root's password made auditing difficult) and stricter separation of duties. Restricting access to the root account via `su` ("switch user" or sometimes thought of as meaaning "superuser", but while the superuser could `su` to any userid knowing only the root user's password, normal users could `su` to any other user if they had the password for the second account, so it is "switch user") was one step toward ending thte practice of directly logging in as root, but it was inadequate so along came `sudo` (pronounced "pseudo" (correct) and often "soo doo", because if you think 'su' stands for 'superuser' it would make sense if this meant 'superuser do', but don't be a lamer; it' pronounced like pseudo.) `sudo` allows a user properly authorized to execute commands as if they were logged in as root, requiring knowledge of only the user's own password, or even no password at all. 

> yeah i just do tho' 
This (along with the "oh" phrasing in the "you still sudo" line before it is basically saying "how quaint you have to abide by those `sudo` rules. "whatevah - I do what I want"

> things i do you ain't able
This is obvious. Perhaps less obvious is that these early bars are kinda lazily vocalized and a bit sloppy wrt the beat. The intent here was to (hopefully) deliver a little story arc by the escalation of rapping "skillz" at certain key points in the song. For this first intro section, that key point is the utterance of "enable!"

> like windows you unstable 
An obvious insult by simile. Rap often makes fun and clever use of similes, often using famous namedrops when talking about (especially bragging about) one's own attributes. Example I've been sitting on that couldn't find a use for in this track: "Like Janet, I'm yellin'" ("I'm yellin', like Janet." Switching the first and last like thatoften makes the recognition of the pun come a little later so it can be funnier at times.)

> enable! 
`enable` was the way to become super user in the old ios (Cisco, not Apple. Cisco used the name first)a on
core layer 3 routers produced by Cisco.

> like Cisco 
As above.

> not the rapper but the router 
Still with the Cisco puns. I am told that Cisco is actually an R&B singer and not a rapper, but I'm still going with my ignorant take because it's a good line and besides, other 50+ year old white guys in tech may have the same confusion of thinking there's a hip hop artist named Cisco, so they'll get the "clever" reference I was making.

> hit the bar 
OK. Work's done, I go to the bar for a beer.

> like the space but in outer
In case you weren't sure what a "bar" is. (Could be four beats from thie songa you're listening to, could be a place to drink a beer, could be the  wide key at the bottom of your keyboard that inserts the space character (ASCII 0x20) so we mention it in simile), but it's not the keyboard space bar, but the "outer" one, ah.. outer space, we guess. Turns out it's a mashup of all of the above - a place to have a beer called the Space Bar, which took its name as the keyboard pun. It is (was?) a real place on the ground floor of the Infomart in Dallas; a place with many datacenters I've done work in and stopped for a drink at.

> where them girlies throwin digits after me 
Obviously, females giving me their phone numbers (digits). Hopefully the picture in your head was influenced by the use of the words "throwin" and "after". Throwin digits sounds appropriately rappish, but in context with "after me" it should become obvious that I was not soliciting said "girlies" for their "digits", but was rather deluged with them to the point where I am fleeing the onslaught.

> efficient like Eratosthenes 
Eratosthenes was a polymath philosopher in Ancient Greece, most famous for calculating Earth's circumference. As a methematician he came up with clever and efficient ways to solve hard calculations. A brag.

> sievin' prime and inequal 
One of Eratosthenes' most famous enduring works is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which separates primes and composite numbers, efficiently. "prime" is doing double duty here, since the context is girlies throwin digits after me while I make my way out of the bar, the prime applies to the girlies, and the "sievin'" I am doing is separating the prime girlies' phone numbers from the others (the "inequal"; I'm taking liberties by making up a word that has a clear meaning to anyone that hears it.)

> sometimes I speak sql 
Random braggadocio fact drop. SQL is pronounced "sequel" and stands for "Structured Query Language". which is a language used by relational databases for querying the contents in a way that allows joining of data from different tables and other useful things, as well as being used for maintenance. It's "sometimes" because the author is not a DBA, but finds it necessary to "speak sql" at times, be it to help out a hapless DBA who doesn't know a solution or to inject SQL into an application for which the author is not responsibler, but is nevertheless giving query capabilities its developer and/or DBA did not think to give to their application (nor sanitize against.)

> I'm unequaled
Maybe I just wanted everyone to know that I know that "inequal" is not a real word. Also, it's a brag.

> L-L-M P-I-M-P 
Just wanted to have a little fun with another rap trope with is the spelling of certain words instead of pronouncing them. This also has a direct connection to technical terms, which are often said both ways. (see `fsck` for example.) LLM is Large Language Model (think ChatGPT) and P-I-M-P spells what it spells.

> i'm multilingual 
Random brag about linguistic skills - spoken language and programming languages. Plus it stack the equal/SQL rhyme with another rhymish word.

> spit a BAR? nah FOO! 
To "spit a bar" is to rap a lyric. FOO and BAR are idiomatic programming variable names, commonly userd together as `FOO BAR` (see "FUBAR"). Also, "Nah, FOO" can be interpreted as "No, fool! I will not spit a bar for you."

> parallel superscalar and virtual 
Cool syllables Interpreted as a brag about capabilities. parallel implies more than one concurrent path, superscalar refers to a processor that executes multiple instructions in parallel, and virtual means a simulated environment such as that of VR, or a physical computer serving as a hypervisor to run multiple "virtual machines", making efficient use of physical resources by providing many simulated computers within, managed by the hypervisor. A brag with lots of syllables that sound technical.

> NLP, Python get it on 
A perhapas subtle reference to linguistic skills. NLP refers to Natural Language Processing, and also Neuro-Linguistic Programming. Python is my default programming language (though I still tend to think in perl. The lyrics don't state this at all; that's just a bit of trivia.) "get it on" rhymes with python as well as indicating that "whatever you throw my way, I'm ready."

> listen to me throw all the wisdom i bestow 
"I say a lot of words and they contain a lot of information you should store as knowledge. You're welcome."

> maybe bash, maybe go 
refers back to my being multilingual

> by and large i undercharge 
You thought my quote/invoice was high? No, you got a deal; the value was much higher than you paid for.

> my intellect don't bother double checked 
What I say (write) is correct. No need to double-check it. (alt: "It's been double-checked already")

> don't gotta guess or recollect
Continuing on about my intellect and how my service provides more value than you paid for: *I* don't have to guess or spend time trying to remember something when you ask for an answer. (alt: You don't have to wonder about my intellect; its' just a fact.)

> pop a shell 
Nerd slang for cleverly finessing a wild shell to appear unexpectedly.

> strace in yo face 
`strace` refers to a Linux debugging utility that intercepts and displays system calls. Often used for trouboeshsooting issues that have eluded the average sysadmin-type as well as being used as an aid in reversing systems or applications at run-time for which ource is either not available or not elightening.

> condition i race 
This is an allusion to `race condition`, which is a common explotable bug where some process depends on conditions to be true that are not guaranteed to be true in a way that is guaranteed predictaable. Usually this manifests in being able to take advantage of some time period between the first action occurring and a second action that depends on the first occurring but not enforcing that the first has occurred or that the process in charge of the first actiondoesn't guarantee the first action was succesful before moving on to another step that assumes the first was successful. This line says the author waits for that gap and alters reality so that when the later step performs its action, the results of the first steps were replaced with what the author wanted the second step to consume. 

> whoami 
This is a command from Unix/Linux (and even Windows and MacOS (which is basically BSD Unix under the hood these days) that returns the username for the currently logged in UID. It seres here as both another way to invoke a rap style self-introduction "who am I?", and as a reference to probably the most common use case for this command, which is to have your exploit call out to it and see what it says. Though the name field may be less than ideal for this purpose (the string "root", which we're specicially looking for might belong to some other uid than 0, if the system owner is some sort of madman.) More appropriately the `id` command is used for such purposes which returns the uid and the username. `whoami` is identical to `id -un`. If your attempt successfully obtained root, after calling `whoami` the return to stdout would be simply:

``` bash
root
```

> zero uid 
Just taking liberties with the nme "UID Zer0" and reminding the listener tht my UID==0

> who; last; w; id
These are multiple commands entered in a row and executed and returned sequentially. The resultant output would look something like:
``` bash
scottvr  pts/0        2026-08-09 04:56 (104.18.0.41)
root     pts/0        2025-07-23 07:52 (:pts/0:S.0)
luser    pts/3        2026-08-09 07:18 (18.233.219.167)
scottvr  pts/0        104.18.0.41    Sun Aug  9 04:56   still logged in
scottvr  pts/0        18.233.219.167    Sat Aug  8 07:29 - 07:31  (00:01)
 07:20:37 up 381 days, 23:29,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT
root            127.0.0.1    04:56   54:50   0.00s  0.03s sshd: scottvr [
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

These are common among first commands that someone logging in as a system for the first time (or the first time using a specific method) might run just to get a feel for the present environment and its inhabitants.

> -I-D Zero
This is just "UID ZERO" but the "U" is implied by the end of the "w" command from the previous line being pronounced just before it.

> process hero
Naturally.

> you knew then I'll be rootin
At some point the listener to whom the author is speaking knew that the author would "be rootin'" would could refer to being recognized as the type to frequently get root on systems, or specifically, that the author would be coming to obtain root from the listener's sysstems.

> no place like localhost
Kinda alludes to "there's no place like home", which was comonly seen as "there's no place like 127.0.0.1" on t-shirts worn by sysadmin types in the 1990's. "localhost" is a hostname alias for 127.0.0.1, which is the "loopback" network interface, which always points to the current system one is on. It in an internal address only, local to each specific system, and is not intended to be a routable address.

> loopback this track
A call back to "localhost" in the previous line, but overloading it with a musical meaning.

> find me back in my home dir
Calling back to both loopback and localhost ("home"), bue specically meaning the default directory for a UID. This is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file mentioned earlier.

> where the hard is
Alludes to "home is where the heart is", but changes heart to "hard", hinting at the "hard drive" or maybe the "hard" contents within it.

> fsck; halt
Two commands, `fsck` (pronounced either "eff ess see kay" or "eff suck") is File System ChecK, used to repair corrupted filesystems (esp: ext2 back in the day, now more broadly for modern filesystems). `halt` refers to (in this context) as shutting down the OS but leaving the hardware in a power-on state. In the days when actual serial consoles (DEC VT100 or Wyse 50/60's and the like)  where attached via actual serial ports on actual servers, this meant the system hardwarae could still be interacted with (e.g., for powering it back on) from the console terminal keyboard.)  Can also refer to a program stoppage, and other similar things synonymous to normal use of the word. Implies something happened on the way to `home` on the `HDD`, possibly a corrupted filesystem, perhaps hich the author intends to fix or maybe offering advice to the listener. Same with `halt`.

> while i grep you just cat
An insult. Literally means the author more efficiently find what he needs, e.g., with a pattern/regex searching text, while the listener is some sort of n00b just blindly dumping all the contents of a file to the screen trying to sift through it with his eyeballs like some Philistine.

> gettin patched
Refers to the author changing something about the listener's system in a procedural, repeatable, idempotent and efficient method, possibly using diff and on the listener's source code, or possibly binary patching executables on the system that root awas obtained on, etc.

> i wrote that with `at`
This is a funny way to claim that even the previous line you just read was written by a scheduled process written prior to the current moment, implying that the author pwned the system in the past but left remnants behind to insult them in the present. Similar to `cron` and often packaed with `crond`, it's a way that users without crontab access can schedule a task to run at a specific time. in the future

> I hack; you are a hack
author does hack: (v) 1. "cleverly solves problems (or sometimes tricks (good and bad) or pranks) using creative methods"; 2. less preferred term among practitioners but synonymous with 'crack'; "breaking in to computer systems" 
listener *is* a hack: (n) "producer of mediocre work"

> I crack
See above.

> and i'll be back
Author has gained entry and will continue to do so.

> to smash yo stack
Intentionally causing a buffer overflow in a program on the listener's machine.

> cuz you whack
Just borrowing a common rap insult term.

> nah you buggin
On second thought, here's another common rap term used derogatorily.

> debuggin with print
This insults the listener's technical proficiency. Many developers these days are completely clueless when it comes to using a debugger, which are seen as arcane and incomprehensible to the l10istener. The unsophisticated listeners just adds copious print statements throughout the code in an effort to understand flow and state at particular points in the code.

> no lint
Another insule to the listener's programming proweess abd hygiend. `lint` refers to a process of automated scanning of source code for correct syntax, unused imports ,unreachable branches, unused branches,and even code-style coherence. This is saying the listener is sloppy.

>  bigint32
`bigint` refers to a manner of programming (or a field type/size in a database) using data types that re large than standard integers. Having a bigint32 variable would imply that you were using bigint but needed explicitlly to use a 32-bit integer type. Useful when using a larger (64-bit) daatatype, perhaps so that you can do a bitwise operation on a 32-bit int against a 64-bit int without explicitly upcasting to a 64-bit int. Mostly here just for the cool sounding syllables. Vaguely a comparison insult.

> no 64
Again this is vague but goess will after the previous line. Probably double down on the comparison insult, or agruing that the bigint 32 was unnecssary because the listener isn't even working with bigints.

> ui?
Literally translates to "User Interface?". Probably an implicit  "G" precedes it, as in "GUI". It's questioning the listener, insinuating they need a GUI. Also here because it sounds like "You I" when sets up the next line.

> you i hack
The answer/copmletion to "UI?" You, I hack.

> can't even crack
(You) can't even crack. An insult to the listener's wannabe skillset.

> you just a bragger
Listener can't back up their claims of proficiency, attribute posession, material possessions, etc.

> can't pirate my swagger
You can't have, even by theft or copying, my earned ego and charisma.

> reppin my seniority
The author carries his seniority on display.

> top - highest priority
`top` is a Unix command that shows a list of running processes and attributes such as CPU utilization, RAM utilization, and the PRIority under which they are running. Top would display this author has havin the highest priority. "Top" also serves as a way to indicated the author's position in the hierarchy.

> can't sudo me 
WOrd play indicating that the listener cannot tell the author what to do under any authority, and also brings to mind "I am the superuser and you cannot become me."

> i'm setuid
setuid() is a process or file attribute indicating that the caller obtains the uid or the file or process specified. It's comonly associated with the root user (uid 0).

> i won't ping back
Author won't respond back to your trivial optional protocl/chatter.
> i'll just ack
But I may acknowledge it.
